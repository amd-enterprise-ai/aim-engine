# AIMClusterModelSource Test: Auth Failure
#
# This test validates that AIMClusterModelSource fails gracefully when
# credentials are missing or invalid for a private registry.
#
# Tested behavior:
# - Source reaches Failed status when authentication fails
# - Ready condition is False
# - No models are created when registry access fails
