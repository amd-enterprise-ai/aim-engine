# AIMClusterModelSource Test: Auto-Sourcing Cluster Models
#
# This test validates that AIMClusterModelSource automatically discovers
# and creates AIMClusterModel resources from a container registry.
#
# Tested behavior:
# - Models are created based on filter patterns
# - Source reaches Ready status
# - Models have correct labels (model-source, origin)
