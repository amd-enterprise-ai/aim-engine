# Custom Model Test: Inline Custom Model (AIMService.spec.model.custom)
#
# This test validates that an AIMService with spec.model.custom automatically
# creates the required AIMModel and AIMServiceTemplate resources.
#
# Tested behavior:
# - AIMService with spec.model.custom auto-creates AIMModel
# - Auto-created AIMModel has correct image, modelSources, and hardware
# - Auto-created AIMModel has managed-by label
# - AIMServiceTemplate is auto-generated from model
# - Service resolves to the auto-created model
# - Service progresses to Starting status
#
