# AIMService E2E Test: Model by Image (Kind)
#
# This test validates that AIMService can reference a model by image URI
# instead of by name. The controller should find or create an AIMModel
# with the specified image, and auto-select a template from discovery.
#
# Uses: ghcr.io/silogen/aim-dummy:0.1.8 (lightweight test image)
