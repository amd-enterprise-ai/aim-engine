# AIMService E2E Test: Happy Path with Caching (GPU)
#
# This test validates AIMService with caching.mode: Always on GPU infrastructure.
# The service uses spec.model.image to reference the model directly.
# With caching enabled, the model is pre-cached before inference starts.
# Also validates chat completions endpoint works correctly.
#
# Uses: amdenterpriseai/aim-qwen-qwen3-32b:0.8.5
# Requires: GPU infrastructure
