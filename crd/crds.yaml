          AIMClusterModel is a cluster-scoped model catalog entry for AIM container images.

          Cluster-scoped models can be referenced by AIMServices in any namespace, making them ideal for
          shared model deployments across teams and projects. Like namespace-scoped AIMModels, cluster models
          trigger discovery jobs to extract metadata and generate service templates.

          When both cluster and namespace models exist for the same container image, services will preferentially
          use the namespace-scoped AIMModel when referenced by image URI.

                    ModelSourceFilter defines a pattern for discovering images.
                    Supports multiple formats:
                    - Repository patterns: "org/repo*" - matches repositories with wildcards
                    - Repository with tag: "org/repo:1.0.0" - exact tag match
                    - Full URI: "ghcr.io/org/repo:1.0.0" - overrides registry and tag
                    - Full URI with wildcard: "ghcr.io/org/repo*" - overrides registry, matches pattern

                        Exclude lists specific repository names to skip (exact match on repository name only, not registry).
                        Useful for excluding base images or experimental versions.

                        Examples:
                        - ["amdenterpriseai/aim-base", "amdenterpriseai/aim-experimental"]
                        - ["silogen/aim-base"] - works with "ghcr.io/silogen/aim-*" (registry is not checked in exclusion)

                        Note: Exclusions match against repository names (e.g., "silogen/aim-base"), not full URIs.

                        Image pattern with wildcard and full URI support.

                        Supported formats:
                        - Repository pattern: "amdenterpriseai/aim-*"
                        - Repository with tag: "silogen/aim-llama:1.0.0" (overrides versions field)
                        - Full URI: "ghcr.io/silogen/aim-google-gemma-3-1b-it:0.8.1-rc1" (overrides spec.registry and versions)
                        - Full URI with wildcard: "ghcr.io/silogen/aim-*" (overrides spec.registry)

                        When a full URI is specified (including registry like ghcr.io), only images from that
                        registry will match. When a tag is included, it takes precedence over the versions field.

                        Wildcard: * matches any sequence of characters.

                        If specified, overrides the global Versions field.
                        Only tags that parse as valid semver are considered (including prereleases like 0.8.1-rc1).
                        Ignored if the Image field includes an explicit tag (e.g., "repo:1.0.0").

                        Examples: ">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0", "~1.2.0" (patch updates), "^1.0.0" (minor updates)

                        Prerelease versions (e.g., 0.8.1-rc1) are supported and follow semver rules:
                        - 0.8.1-rc1 matches ">=0.8.0" (prerelease is part of version 0.8.1)
                        - Use ">=0.8.1-rc1" to match only that prerelease or higher
                        - Leave empty to match all tags (including prereleases and non-semver tags)

                  Versions specifies global semantic version constraints applied to all filters.
                  Individual filters can override this with their own version constraints.
                  Constraints use semver syntax: >=1.0.0, <2.0.0, ~1.2.0, ^1.0.0, etc.
                  Non-semver tags (e.g., "latest", "dev") are silently skipped.

                  Version ranges work on all registries (including ghcr.io, gcr.io) when combined with
                  exact repository names (no wildcards). The controller uses the Tags List API to fetch
                  all tags for the repository and filters them by the semver constraint.

                  Example: registry=ghcr.io, filters=[{image: "silogen/aim-llama"}], versions=[">=1.0.0"]
                  will fetch all tags from ghcr.io/silogen/aim-llama and include only those >=1.0.0.

          AIMClusterRuntimeConfig is a cluster-scoped runtime configuration for AIM services, models, and templates.

          Cluster-scoped runtime configs provide platform-wide defaults that apply to all namespaces,
          making them ideal for organization-level policies such as storage classes, discovery behavior,
          model creation scope, and routing configuration.

          When both cluster and namespace runtime configs exist with the same name, the configs are merged, and
          the namespace-scoped AIMRuntimeConfig takes precedence for any field that is set in both.

                          any namespace to the Service.

                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                          ParentRef of the Route.

                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port

          AIMClusterServiceTemplate is a cluster-scoped template that defines runtime profiles for AIM services.

          Cluster-scoped templates can be used by AIMServices in any namespace, making them ideal for
          platform-wide model configurations that should be shared across teams and projects.
          Unlike namespace-scoped AIMServiceTemplates, cluster templates do not support caching configuration
          and must be managed by cluster administrators, since caches themselves are namespace-scoped.

          When both cluster and namespace templates exist with the same name, the namespace-scoped template
          takes precedence for services in that namespace.

                  LabelPropagation controls how labels from parent AIM resources are propagated to child resources.
                  When enabled, labels matching the specified patterns are automatically copied from parent resources
                  (e.g., AIMService, AIMTemplateCache) to their child resources (e.g., Deployments, Services, PVCs).
                  This is useful for propagating organizational metadata like cost centers, team identifiers,
                  or compliance labels through the resource hierarchy.

                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                          ParentRef of the Route.

                        Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded
                        using the previously defined environment variables in the container and
                        any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,
                        the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                        to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.

              AIMServiceTemplateSpec defines the desired state of AIMServiceTemplate (namespace-scoped).

              A namespaced and versioned template that selects a runtime profile
              for a given AIM model (by canonical name). Templates are intentionally
              narrow: they describe runtime selection knobs for the AIM container and do
              not redefine the full Kubernetes deployment shape.

                        with respect to the current state of the instance.
