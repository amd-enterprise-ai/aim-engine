## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- Artifact storage quota enforcement with configurable cluster-wide and per-namespace limits via `artifactStorageQuota` in RuntimeConfig (#60)
- Automatic artifact eviction when storage quota is exceeded, with priority-based ordering via `retentionPriority` and `defaultRetentionPriority` (#60)
- Eviction protection annotation (`aim.eai.amd.com/eviction-protected`) to exempt specific artifacts from automatic eviction (#60)
- Download filter support (`downloadFilter`) on AIMArtifact and RuntimeConfig to control which files are included/excluded during HuggingFace downloads — subdirectory files are now excluded by default (#56)
- Custom profile support for AIMServiceTemplate and AIMModel custom templates — define inline engine args and env vars without needing a pre-built AIM image (#61)
- `priorityClassName` field on AIMService to set Kubernetes PriorityClass on inference pods (#50)
- AIMService annotations are now included in generated HTTPRoutes, with service annotations taking precedence over runtime config annotations (#55)
- Template health checks surfaced in AIMService status with selection reason and message (#31)

### Changed
- Artifact downloader image version is now set at build time via ldflags to match the release tag, replacing the hardcoded default (#15)
- Runtime status replica fields (`currentReplicas`, `desiredReplicas`, `minReplicas`, `maxReplicas`) are now always reported, including zero values on startup (#58)
- AIMService status remains `Running` while scaling when ready pods still exist, using new `RuntimeScaling` reason (#59)
- Cache status messages now propagate root cause from template cache conditions instead of generic strings (#53)
- CI workflows updated: artifact downloader builds on tags with configurable version input, publish-main workflow for package repository (#15, #57)

### Fixed
- Environment variable expansion and kustomize build overwrite bug resolved (#49)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-20

Initial public release of AIM Engine — a Kubernetes operator for deploying AI inference workloads on AMD Instinct GPUs.

## Highlights

- **Declarative inference deployment** — Deploy production-ready endpoints with a single `AIMService` resource. The operator handles model resolution, template selection, KServe InferenceService creation, and HTTP routing.
- **Built for optimized AIM images** — Pre-built containers packaging open-source models tuned for AMD Instinct GPUs with optimized serving runtimes.
- **Automatic model catalog** — Discover AIM images from container registries with wildcard filters, version constraints, and periodic sync.
- **Smart template selection** — Multi-stage algorithm selects the optimal runtime profile based on GPU availability, precision, and optimization metric.
- **Model caching** — Pre-download model weights to shared PVCs. Shared and Dedicated modes control lifecycle and reuse.
- **Multi-protocol downloads** — HuggingFace downloads with configurable protocol fallback (XET, HF_TRANSFER, HTTP).
- **Gateway API routing** — HTTPRoute creation with customizable path templates.
- **KEDA autoscaling** — Scale on OpenTelemetry metrics from the vLLM runtime.
- **Multi-tenancy** — Namespace and cluster-scoped resource variants with resolution order and label propagation.
