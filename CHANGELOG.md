## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-20

Initial public release of AIM Engine — a Kubernetes operator for deploying AI inference workloads on AMD Instinct GPUs.

## Highlights

- **Declarative inference deployment** — Deploy production-ready endpoints with a single `AIMService` resource. The operator handles model resolution, template selection, KServe InferenceService creation, and HTTP routing.
- **Built for optimized AIM images** — Pre-built containers packaging open-source models tuned for AMD Instinct GPUs with optimized serving runtimes.
- **Automatic model catalog** — Discover AIM images from container registries with wildcard filters, version constraints, and periodic sync.
- **Smart template selection** — Multi-stage algorithm selects the optimal runtime profile based on GPU availability, precision, and optimization metric.
- **Model caching** — Pre-download model weights to shared PVCs. Shared and Dedicated modes control lifecycle and reuse.
- **Multi-protocol downloads** — HuggingFace downloads with configurable protocol fallback (XET, HF_TRANSFER, HTTP).
- **Gateway API routing** — HTTPRoute creation with customizable path templates.
- **KEDA autoscaling** — Scale on OpenTelemetry metrics from the vLLM runtime.
- **Multi-tenancy** — Namespace and cluster-scoped resource variants with resolution order and label propagation.
