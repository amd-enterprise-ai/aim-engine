# Dockerignore - allowlist approach
# Exclude everything, then selectively include what's needed for build

# Ignore everything by default

# Allow essential build files
!go.mod
!go.sum
!Dockerfile

# Allow source directories needed for build
!cmd/
!internal/
!api/

# But exclude certain files within allowed directories
