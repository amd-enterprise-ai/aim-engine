                          Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                          boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                          allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                          generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                          routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                          any namespace to the Service.

                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                          ParentRef of the Route.

                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.

                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment

                      The template is rendered against the AIMService object to generate unique paths.

                      Example templates:
                      - `/{.metadata.namespace}/{.metadata.name}` - namespace and service name

                      - `/models/{.spec.aimModelName}` - based on model name

                      The template must:
                      - Use valid JSONPath expressions wrapped in {...}
                      - Reference fields that exist on the service

                      - Result in valid URL path segments (lowercase, RFC 1123 compliant)

                      If evaluation fails, the service enters Degraded state with PathTemplateInvalid reason.
