                          Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace

                          allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                          generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                          routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                          any namespace to the Service.

                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                          ParentRef of the Route.
