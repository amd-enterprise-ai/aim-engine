          AIMClusterServiceTemplate is a cluster-scoped template that defines runtime profiles for AIM services.

          Cluster-scoped templates can be used by AIMServices in any namespace, making them ideal for
          platform-wide model configurations that should be shared across teams and projects.
          Unlike namespace-scoped AIMServiceTemplates, cluster templates do not support caching configuration
          and must be managed by cluster administrators, since caches themselves are namespace-scoped.

          When both cluster and namespace templates exist with the same name, the namespace-scoped template
          takes precedence for services in that namespace.
